# Hack-Town-Twitch-API

## Overview

Using the Twitch API v3(https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API), this project retrieves the top 4 video game streams based on views of Twitch, a popular video game streaming site. The top 4 video game streams will update every time the user refreshes the page or clicks another page. The developer's choice, however will always be Dark Souls.
